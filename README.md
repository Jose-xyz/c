#### **Why learn C?**
---
Learning C because I found that a lot of programming langages I have used borrow from C. I figure if I learn C then any language down the road is going to be easier to learn. 
I am also interested in OS development.

#### **How did you complete the lessons?** 
----
Completed lessons using vscode on Ubuntu WSL.

#### **Why WSL?**
-
I ran into issues where I could not get the Windows set up to work. I am sure it was something simple. 

I found the setting up to get started way easier on Linux, in this case Ubuntu WSL. I downloaded dev tools like gcc. 
Then used tilde (~) + ctrl to drop in the terminal window to compile code. 

#### **Why VScode?**
---
I like VScode's features for auto-complete and its clean UI. I also use the VIM extension. 
Helps me keep my hands on the keyboard. 


#### **Common Commands**
---
Compiled code using gcc - `gcc codefile.c -o codefile`
I would also add the AND operator (`&&`) to the end to excute as well like `gcc codefile.c -o codefile && ./codefile`
