Completed lessons using vscode on Ubuntu WSL.

##### Why WSL?

I ran into issues where I could not get the Windows set up to work. I am sure it was something simple. 

I found the setting up to get started way easier on Linux, in this case Ubuntu WSL. I downloaded dev tools like gcc. 
Then used tilde (~) + ctrl to drop in the terminal window to compile code. 

##### Why VScode?

I like VS codes features for auto-complete and clean UI. I also use the VIM extension. 
Helps me keep my hands on the keyboard. 


##### Common Commands

Compiled code using gcc - `gcc codefile.c -o codefile`
I would also add the AND operator (`&&`) to the end to excute as well like `gcc codefile.c -o codefile && ./codefile`
